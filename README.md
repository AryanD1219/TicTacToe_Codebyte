# TicTacToe_Codebyte
Team Members: Aryan Dubey and Mrunali Bhamre
We are Team Codebyte and this is problem statement 3 of Beginner's Track.
We have created two sets of code- one displaying a basic tic-tac-toe game with an option to choose between your playing role (X or O) and the other a more advanced line of code trying to implement the minimax algorithm to play against the computer. It is still under development.
